# Orange Split

For every claim made in a Hacker News thread or pasted article, how many people or attributed voices are for it, against it, in the middle, or self-contradicting.

## Original motivation

The original motivation was to assess the reaction to Fable 5.1.

## Practical utility and lessons

This tool is of very limited practical utility. Since it focuses on polarization, its thread analysis does not surface interesting opinions or side stories, help user build an understanding of individual community members, or substitute for reading the comments or the article people are responding to. 

The main lesson from building it is that automated model selection is expensive, time-consuming, and of suspect quality. 

The model to model comparisons (shown below) that inform the model select UI are somewhat useful.

## Goal

Given a Hacker News comment thread id or pasted article, produce the bipolar axes along which commenters disagree, with no human in the loop.

## \<SLOP STARTS HERE\>

## Model comparison

The four model pickers show one benchmark, measured on one Hacker News thread (id 22866284, 323 comments). Agreement with silver states how closely a choice's output in a role matches what GPT-6.1 Sol at xhigh reasoning effort and Claude Opus 5.5 at high reasoning effort agree on; **Silver reference and benchmark** describes the method. Agreement, precision, and recall are means over the runs in the Runs column. Cost and latency are forecasts of the role's stage for a thread of 1000 comments, from the first run. `node scripts/benchmark.js --embed` rewrites these tables from `data/silver-benchmark.json`.

## Input

- Thread id, or plain text through **Paste article**.
- OpenRouter key, pasted on the page or obtained by signing in with OpenRouter. An OAuth key is remembered in the browser automatically; a pasted key is held in memory and gone on reload unless "Remember pasted key" is ticked.
- Benchmark thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22866284 ("The Wolfram Physics Project", 323 comments). The silver reference and every picker figure come from it.

## Pasted articles

Choose **Paste article**, paste unformatted text, optionally add a title, and press **Run**. The full article is selected automatically; the HN comment-share slider is hidden. Up to 100,000 characters are accepted. Longer input is rejected explicitly, never truncated. The estimate includes additional preparation and review allowances; these are heuristics, not measured article benchmarks or price caps. All calls share the selected models, budget, cancellation, billing safeguards and cache.

Preparation sends the whole article with numbered words to the extraction model. It returns an exhaustive partition of word ranges, a speaker registry, and attribution kinds. Code validates complete ordered coverage and grounded speaker labels, then extracts exact source spans. The author is one voice across all their passages; repeated quoted speakers share an identity. Duplicate quotations by the same speaker count once. Direct quotations and the author's own assertions enter scoring. Reported paraphrases and unresolved attribution remain visible separately and add no votes. Neutral framing and headings remain in the original text. These are automatic model judgments, not authenticated testimony or a representative survey.

Standalone poems, monologues and soliloquies are supported. Their continuous primary voice uses the same source-local identity as an essay author, even without a name; this does not identify a historical person or attribute a character's beliefs to the literary author. Anonymous quotations embedded in reporting and unclear speaker turns remain unresolved. A passage that explicitly weighs incompatible alternatives with reasons can yield a comparison without choosing either side. Such deliberation can count as one middle voice after both scoring passes agree; merely posing a question adds no stance. If attribution excludes every passage, the result explains that comparison analysis did not run.

The prepared passages use extraction, consolidation, two scoring passes and per-person counting. Before scoring, an additional consolidation-model review rejects axes whose statements can both be true or ask different questions. The article summary receives explicit flags identifying comparisons with actual opposing votes, plus complete supporting passages stored once in its context. Another review checks it against that evidence. An unsupported summary gets at most one semantic revision, separately from the one format-repair allowance; persistent failure hides the prose and preserves usable comparisons. These checks reduce errors but do not establish the truth of quoted claims.

Clicking a count opens its attributed voices and passages below the paragraph. **Show in article** highlights the exact passage in the complete original. The author's name and speaker labels are needed during preparation; downstream identity metadata uses anonymous voice IDs. Original text and quotations retain their supplied wording. Single-author articles describe that author's claims, not paragraph counts as public opinion.

Articles and results use content-based IDs alongside HN snapshots in the browser cache. Their original text, attribution responses, reviews and results are included in cache export/import. Run URLs contain an ID and settings, not the article text. A URL can reopen the source only in a browser holding that source or after importing its cache. Editing the text or title selects a new source and removes the previous result; only fully cached work starts automatically without a paid call.

The headless runner supports the same workflow:

```
node scripts/run_node.js --article-file=article.txt --title="Optional title" --cache-dir=cache --out=result.json --budget=1
```

`--article-file` and `--thread` are mutually exclusive; articles require `--share=100`. Article JSON results include the full source, passage offsets and anonymous counted comments. The normal model and sampling flags apply to preparation and reviews through their respective roles.

## Definition of an axis

An axis is a pair of incompatible statements that answer the same question, such that one commenter could hold the first and another the second: "remote work makes teams less productive", "static typing prevents more bugs than it costs in effort", "the paper's main result will replicate". An overall verdict counts when phrased as a statement ("the product is worth its price" versus "the product is not worth its price"). Not axes: topics ("pricing"), mood without a claim ("I'm disappointed"), traits of the commenter ("has used the product for years"). In a thread, an axis is one question the discussion argues about, broad enough to gather the people who address it: a reader is shown how many people take each side, so an axis that one person holds says nothing. The tool judges opinions, not people: commenter names never appear in the output or in any prompt.

## Output

A final model synthesis covers where the discussion agrees, then where it splits, then where it leans, under the same group headings as the comparisons, including supported minority arguments where useful. It targets 200–300 words in 3–4 concise paragraphs, with one or two supporting comparisons per paragraph (less for thin evidence). The summary states each side of a disagreement in its own words, and the count of people holding that side follows those words: "some argue the price is fair **(64)**, while others find it too high **(18)**". Middle/conditional views and self contradiction get no count in the summary; they remain in **Explore comparisons**. A one-sided comparison shows only the supported side, and with enough people it counts as agreement: no one in the analyzed selection took the other side. Counts are recomputed from verified rows, never supplied by the model. Each number opens only that stance's people and comments immediately below its paragraph, without jumping to or expanding **Explore comparisons (N)**. Button labels and tooltips identify the stance, and evidence headings distinguish people from comments. All comparisons, scope, caveats, and warnings start collapsed. Within each comparison the better-supported view is blue and the opposing view orange.

## Constraints

- No human review.
- Models are called through OpenRouter. Defaults: GPT-6 Luna low for extraction, GPT-6.1 Sol low for consolidation, GPT-5.6 Luna low for scoring, and GPT-6 Sol low for the summary. **Choosing the defaults** under **Silver reference and benchmark** gives the rule and the evidence. The defaults are fixed in the page, so a later benchmark run changes one only through an edit.
- A run never spends past the Max cost box (default 1 dollar) on extraction and scoring calls, which run up to 30 at once. Before sending each of those calls, the page and runner reserve the most it can cost: its request bytes plus 4,096 at the higher of the input and cache-write prices, plus its output ceiling at the output price, from OpenRouter's model list; a model with a variable price, such as Jev Router, gets the highest listed price. The call is sent only while spent plus reserved stays within the budget. Consolidation, summary, and the article stages make one call at a time, whose worst case is far above its usual cost, so each is sent while spend is under the budget, and that one call can pass it. Cached calls reserve nothing. A refused call stops the run; finished calls stay cached, so a rerun with a higher Max cost does not pay for them again.
- If OpenRouter omits `usage.cost`, the client reads the generation's billed `total_cost` from [generation metadata](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/generations/get-generation), with up to three reads (10-second timeout each) for delayed billing. It never substitutes zero or a price estimate. If billing remains unknown, new work stops, already in-flight calls finish and cache normally, and the raw response is saved for a same-settings retry that checks billing without repeating the paid generation. Unresolved responses are not free cache hits; recovered charges count toward the retry's budget. Reported spend excludes unresolved charges (explicitly warned). If storage fails, the error warns that reloading or starting another run can lose this protection.

## Files

- `hn_polarization.html`: the app, in one self-contained page. `<script id="core">` holds the pipeline with no DOM access; `<script id="page">` holds the browser glue.
- `scripts/load_core.js`: evaluates the core block as a Node module for the scripts, so there is no build step and no second copy of the pipeline, and holds the command-line helpers every script uses.
- `scripts/run_node.js`: headless runner with options for models, caching, thread files, comment share, and budget.
- `scripts/silver.js`: builds the silver reference for one thread into `data/silver.json`; `scripts/benchmark.js`: grades picker choices against it into `data/silver-benchmark.json`, embeds the results in the page, and rewrites the tables under **Model comparison**. Their model calls are cached under `outputs/silver`, which Git ignores.
- `scripts/pipeline_runs.js`: runs whole pipelines, one configuration of the four role choices at a time, on threads 22866284 and 44163063, and records for each run its axes, its rows outside "too few", its stances, its cost and latency, and on thread 22866284 its F1 against silver, into `data/pipeline-benchmark.json`. `--repeats=<n>` adds runs, each with its own call cache.
- `scripts/single_call.js`: measures one request that replaces the extraction, consolidation, and scoring stages, for the models and reasoning efforts it lists, alone and with one whole-thread scoring call added, with the same figures as `scripts/pipeline_runs.js`, into `data/single-call-benchmark.json`. `--repeats=<n>` adds runs. The page does not use the results.
- `scripts/silver_lib.js`: what the four benchmark scripts share: the call cache and its repeats, the silver reference, and the grading of a stage and of a whole run.
- `scripts/csp.js`: recomputes the Content-Security-Policy hashes of the page's two script blocks and its style block; `node scripts/csp.js` reports whether the policy is current, `--write` rewrites it. A browser refuses an inline block whose hash the policy does not name. Run `node scripts/csp.js --write` after editing an inline block.
- `.gitattributes`: makes every text file LF on every platform; its comment explains why the policy hashes do not depend on it.

## User interface

The app is hosted at https://andyrosa.github.io/orange_split/.
The public source repository is https://github.com/andyrosa/orange_split.

Every push to `main` runs `node scripts/csp.js`, which stops the deployment when the Content-Security-Policy is stale,
and deploys through `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. The workflow publishes only
`hn_polarization.html`, copied byte-for-byte to `index.html`. Cache exports, prototypes,
documentation, scripts, and tests are not included in the website. GitHub Pages must
use **GitHub Actions** as its publishing source. Deployment can also be started manually
from the repository's **Actions** tab.

Keep credentials in the browser or the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable; never commit them.

Open `hn_polarization.html` in a browser. The tab title names Orange Split and changes to the loaded article title. Every button sits right after the thing it acts on and appears only when it can do something.

The four model selectors show only the selected names side by side, wrapping to a second line if needed. Click a name to reveal its property columns in a wide popover; on narrow screens the columns scroll inside it. Numeric property cells use a separate red–yellow–green scale for each column: green is best, yellow is the midpoint, and red is worst. Lower cost and latency are better; higher agreement is better. Text, missing measurements, and columns with no variation stay neutral. Accessible labels and tooltips identify each model's role. Selecting a model or pressing Escape closes the popover, as does clicking outside it.

On mobile, story-selector rows put the title above the smaller details, with both wrapping as needed so the full title and metadata remain readable. Wider screens retain the compact single-line layout.

1. Pick **Front page** or **Search all**, then use the leftmost Thread box. Front page lists the first 30 stories in Hacker News's ranking. Click the selected **Front page** button to switch to **Front page +1**, covering the first 60 stories; click again to return to 30. Typing filters the selected list locally, and **Min comments** applies to both sizes. Returning from **Search all** or **Paste article** starts at 30. Search all waits for three characters, then shows at most 30 Algolia story matches. A numeric thread id loads directly in either mode. The full-width list opens under the box on focus, click, or typing. Each row shows the linked title, current comment count, posting time, id, fetched snapshot count, new-comment difference, and preprocessing status. Clicking the title opens the Hacker News post in a new tab; clicking elsewhere loads it for analysis. A bold title means at least one model call or a completed result for the selected run is already cached; a snapshot alone does not bold it. Status distinguishes a saved result, fully cached calls, partial calls, snapshot only, or not stored. The Min comments box to its right hides stories with fewer comments from both lists; default 100, empty hides nothing. Arrow keys move the highlight, Enter or a row click picks, and Escape or leaving the box closes. A picked row or a typed id ("Load thread", Enter, or leaving the box) loads the thread; the box empties and the loaded title follows it as another new-tab link to the Hacker News post. The line below compares HN's current comment count with the stored snapshot. When they match it reads, for example, "32 comments, posted 2026-09-02 09:24 PM, id 49543530, fetched comments on 2026-09-02 09:25 PM". When new comments exist, the older snapshot count is repeated in bold after "fetched" (for example, "35 comments ... fetched **32** comments on ..."). Import changes its button to **Importing…**, reports the file being processed, and disables conflicting cache controls until storage and cache checks finish.
2. Choose extraction, consolidation, scoring, and summary models independently from four keyboard-accessible grid dropdowns, in the order the stages run. Every dropdown has the same five columns: model, reasoning effort, cost and latency for a thread of 1000 comments, and agreement with silver; the line under its rows states what agreement means. Extraction and scoring choose from one list, consolidation and summary from another; the tables under **Model comparison** list both. Each choice is measured separately in each role, with every other stage fixed to the silver reference, so the figures of one picker do not depend on the choices in the others. The one exception is the consolidation cost and latency, which grow with the number of candidates and are shown for the default extraction choice. A choice whose output stayed invalid on the benchmark thread reads "Failed". Jev Router (`typesafe/jev-router`) chooses the model and reasoning effort for each request, and OpenRouter lists no price for it, so it cannot be measured: its cells read "Not measured" and stay neutral, and a forecast assumes the costliest and slowest measured choice of the role. It receives the lookaround-free summary pattern, as every OpenAI and Anthropic model does, because it can pick a model that rejects lookaround.
3. Set the Max cost box, default $1. It is the budget the run stops at; whenever it, a model, or the thread changes, the page sets the slider to the largest share of top comments whose forecast fits (well under 100% for Opus 5 on a large thread). The slider can then be moved by hand. It keeps the first N% of comments in thread order, Hacker News's own ranking, depth-first, so every reply in the share has its parent in it and the same percentage always gives the same comments. The text beside it shows the comments that leaves, their text size in characters, and, as "Next run:", the forecast cost and latency, from the benchmark figures of the four chosen models: extraction and scoring in proportion to the characters, consolidation in proportion to the candidates the extraction choice produces, and the summary at a fixed cost per run, because it reads at most forty axes whatever the thread size. A batched stage takes at least as long as its slowest benchmark call. The page also counts the run's model calls already in the cache, by building every request and looking it up; the count stops at the first stage with a miss. With some calls cached a sentence lists them per stage; with all cached the line reads "Next run: $0 and 0 seconds" and a just-loaded thread runs by itself, with or without a key. A result describes one selection, so changing the share, a model, or the budget removes the result on the page and the line reporting it, and the status line says so. When the new selection turns out fully cached the run starts by itself there too, replacing the run URL instead of adding a history entry, so dragging the slider does not fill the browser history. Returning the slider to the selection whose result is on the page changes nothing.
4. Provide a key if none is held, then press Run (enabled once a thread is loaded, the share is above 0, and a key is held or typed, or the run is fully cached). While Run is disabled the text beside it names what is still missing: "Load a thread to run.", "Move the slider above 0% to run.", or "Enter an OpenRouter key to run." Either paste a key, or press "Sign in with OpenRouter instead": a PKCE code challenge to openrouter.ai, exchanged on return for a key bound to that account, with no secret and no server; the button appears only when the page is served over http(s) from a stable URL, since OpenRouter needs a callback URL and the browser a secure context. The key is never displayed again. While one is held the entry field disappears and "OpenRouter key" and a Delete button appear on the storage line; the key label's tooltip indicates "held until reload" or "remembered in this browser". Run adds the article, snapshot capture time, comment share, all four model choices, and budget to the page URL. Only the current run URL and saved-result formats are read; older ones are ignored. The snapshot time uses ISO UTC in the URL as the nonce tying that URL to the cached result; visible snapshot, posted, and fetched times use local `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm AM/PM`, except for the compact cache range described below. Reopening the URL restores its controls and completed result. During a run the status line shows the stage, units done, calls in flight, call count, cached calls, running cost, and elapsed time. The completion line shows actual time and cost followed by their pre-run estimates in parentheses. A classification is one comment placed on one row. Cancel aborts the in-flight requests.

OpenRouter sign-in pre-fills the new key's label with the app name and the browser and OS when detectable, for example `Orange Split - Edge on Windows` or `Orange Split - Safari on macOS`. Browser detection is a best-effort reminder, without version numbers. Webpages cannot read browser profile names; add a nickname such as "Work profile" in OpenRouter's editable key-label field if needed. This uses the [OAuth `key_label` parameter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/overview/auth/oauth). For localhost callbacks, OpenRouter's authorization heading uses the host and port; the custom label identifies the saved key.

Caches use the browser's IndexedDB. Storage belongs to the origin (scheme, host, port), not the file name. The remembered OpenRouter key is stored in localStorage. Besides the remembered key, three caches are kept: fetched thread snapshots keyed by article id; finished model calls keyed by request content, so failed runs resume where they stopped; and saved results keyed by all run URL parameters, so reopening one of those exact finished run configurations restores its page directly. The storage line counts AI calls and summaries. Stored thread snapshots and pasted articles are not listed; they stay stored so summaries can reopen and the thread picker can load a stored snapshot without refetching it. Model calls can be reusable pieces from partial runs or different settings, so their count does not imply the same number of saved results. The summaries count is a disclosure listing saved results newest first. Each entry shows the title, the four models, the comment share, the cost and model-call count of the run that saved it, that run's elapsed time, and the save time. A run served entirely from cache shows $0.00. A result saved by a run that only replayed cached calls shows "time not recorded". When every call for a selected configuration is cached, loading its thread reconstructs the result for free and saves that result under the current settings. Export downloads all three caches as JSON without the OpenRouter key. Import merges such a file into the browser in one transaction while leaving the OpenRouter key untouched. Import compares content before dates, ignoring save and fetch metadata when checking equality. Identical content is not reported as an update; its stored dates silently advance to the newest valid date from either copy. A differing entry replaces the browser copy only when both have valid dates and the imported copy is strictly newer: thread snapshots use their fetch dates; newly saved AI calls and summaries carry save dates. For differing content, older imports, equal-date conflicts, and conflicts with missing or invalid dates keep the browser copy. The export file date is never used to infer an entry's age. Import reports new entries, actual updates, and differing entries it kept; it checks the current stored values inside the transaction to protect newer writes from other tabs. If storage refuses an import, the previous cache remains intact. Delete removes all three caches and never the key.

The **Min comments** arrow buttons and Up/Down keys double/halve the threshold (100 → 200 → 400; 100 → 50 → 25), rounding down to whole numbers. Up from empty or zero starts at 1; Down stops at 0. Arrow adjustments cap at JavaScript's maximum safe integer. Direct typing is unrestricted and refreshes the filter immediately. This setting resets to 100 on reload.

The cache line reads `Cached locally: N AI calls, N summaries YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm to YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm`. Its range uses the earliest and latest cached thread snapshot fetch times, in local time with a 24-hour clock. No range is shown when there are no cached snapshots.

## Key handling

The page is one HTML file with no dependencies and no third-party script. The OpenRouter key is sent only to openrouter.ai; view-source shows every fetch, and a Content-Security-Policy on the page limits connections to openrouter.ai, hn.algolia.com, and hacker-news.firebaseio.com. Input, above, says how long a key is kept. Use the Delete button to remove either kind. Create the key with a credit limit, or use Sign in with OpenRouter and set a limit on the resulting key in the dashboard, where it can also be revoked.

## Pipeline

1. Extract. Comments are batched in thread order at about 12,000 characters, keeping top-level subtrees together when they fit. For each batch the model lists candidate axes: two incompatible statements plus the ids of comments in the batch holding each; ids from outside the batch are dropped with a warning. A thread candidate states the question the comments argue about, not one comment's wording or reason; a pasted article keeps specific claims apart.
2. Consolidate. One call merges all candidates into axes and lists, for each axis, the numbers of the candidates merged into it, each candidate under one axis. For a thread, candidates that answer the same question merge into one axis, including narrower facets, reasons, examples, and consequences of one of its sides; two questions stay apart only when several comments hold each and a commenter could take opposite sides on them; a candidate held by one or two comments is merged into a broader axis or left out. No target count. The pipeline then counts the distinct authors of the comments each axis's candidates cite and does not score a thread axis held by fewer than 2 people; the comparisons list says how many were left out. A pasted article keeps the earlier rule (candidates merge only when a voice on side 1 of one would almost certainly be on side 1 of the other) and keeps every axis. This call is not split; malformed or truncated output can receive one format repair, described below. Its output ceiling is 128k tokens for every consolidator but Gemini 3.8 Flash, whose ceiling is 65,536.
3. Score. Every comment, with an excerpt of its parent (the parent's own words, skipping quoted lines), is classified against every axis in batches of 20: statement 1, statement 2, middle, or not addressed. Two passes, the second with the axes shuffled and the statements swapped; only stances both passes agree on count. The completion report separates true conflicts (both passes classify the pair differently) from single-pass classifications (one pass classifies it and the other omits it). Five leave-out rules: the parent excerpt only resolves what the comment refers to and its position is never the comment's; words that only agree or disagree with the parent carry no position; a line starting with > is not the commenter's claim; a position attributed to someone else is not the commenter's; holding one statement while granting a point to the other is that side, not middle. Extraction applies the second and third of these as well.
4. Compute. Count each person once per axis. Repeating the same stance does not add votes. A person with verified comments on both opposing sides counts in a separate **self contradiction** class, never on either side or in the middle, regardless of how often either stance occurs. Otherwise use the majority verified stance, with ties counting as middle. The side with more people becomes statement 1. Each axis falls into one of four groups by the 95% Wilson score interval of the larger side's share of the people on sides 1 and 2; middle, self contradiction, and unverified comments are excluded. **Consensus**: the interval lies above one half and the share is at least 75%. **Split**: the share is at most 65% and the whole interval lies below 75%, so enough people were counted to rule out a consensus; 97-55 and 30-30 are splits. **Leaning**: the interval lies above one half, short of either. **Too few**: everything else, such as 2-1 or 6-4. Groups appear in that order. Within a group, consensus and leaning axes rank by the interval's lower bound and split axes by the lower bound of the smaller side's share, highest first; more people on the two sides, then statement text, break ties. The comparisons list shows a heading for each non-empty group. Saved results recompute these counts from their evidence without new model calls.
5. Synthesize. One final call uses the selected summary model, its sampling/reasoning settings, and a 16,000-token output ceiling. Both the prompt and the API request explicitly require the JSON schema, with narrative prose inside `sections[].text`, not a standalone Markdown answer. Each section cites 1–2 axes with stance markers: `[[axis:ID:A]]` immediately after the words stating statement 1 and `[[axis:ID:B]]` after the words stating statement 2, with the cited IDs listed once in `axisIds`, in marker order. For example: `{"text":"Some find the price fair[[axis:1:A]], while others find it too high[[axis:1:B]].","axisIds":[1]}`. Every axis a section cites must belong to one group, and the sections must follow the group order; the page shows the group's heading before the first section of each group. Article summaries are not grouped. Square brackets are reserved for markers. Missing, malformed, unknown, duplicated, mismatched, leading, or adjacent markers fail shared validation and use the same bounded repair path as other format errors. Word limits use whitespace splitting, including standalone marker tokens; markers should attach directly to preceding prose. The renderer replaces markers in place with verified numeric buttons and inserts all surrounding prose as text nodes, never HTML. Context includes up to forty ranked axes with deterministic people counts and up to two distinct-author excerpts per class, capped at 700 characters each. Author names are not included. The prompt forbids invented facts or cross-axis author camps, treats a one-sided axis as agreement among the people counted, and permits supported minority arguments. This is model interpretation, not fact checking; bounded excerpts can miss nuance. No verified axes means no synthesis call.

Synthesis participates in progress, cancellation, budget accounting, cache probing, and exported caches in both page and runner. Forecasts add the selected summary model's benchmark cost and latency, the same for every thread. These estimates include the repair calls the benchmark run made but are not hard price caps. A synthesis call can exceed the budget before its billed usage is known. A failed, cancelled, malformed, or over-budget synthesis leaves comparisons usable and explicitly reports the missing summary. Format failures report the original validation error and any repair failure or budget/cancellation block. Rejected output is preserved in the saved result's `synthesisFailure.response`, plus `repairResponse` when available, for diagnosis only, never as a displayed summary.

All stages share the same validation path for fresh output and cache replay. Accepted formats include JSON fences, bare statement/stance arrays, and scoring's per-comment axis-to-stance maps. Arbitrary Markdown is **not** treated as valid structured output. Extraction/scoring responses that are malformed or truncated split into smaller batches down to one comment. Consolidation and synthesis cannot split: each gets **at most one automatic format-repair call per run**, using the same model/settings, original context, rejected output, validation error, and schema. Repair does not repeat extraction, consolidation, or scoring work already completed.

Original calls and repairs are both counted and billed, even when invalid. Exhausted budget, unknown billing, or cancellation prevents repair from starting. Terminal errors stop queued work without aborting other in-flight calls, which finish and cache normally; explicit Cancel still aborts requests. Paid malformed output is saved in the model cache as JSON or a raw-response diagnostic, not as a successful summary. A same-settings rerun reuses that original to attempt only the missing/failed repair; successful repairs replay for free. A failed one-comment batch can be retried on an explicit rerun. Probing follows the same recovery path without model calls: reusable originals count as hits, but a missing/invalid repair is a miss, so incomplete summaries cannot trigger a paid automatic run. Storage failure is warned because a new run or reload may lose retained output and repeat a paid call.

Saved summaries reopen without API calls when their format is supported. Regenerating an incompatible summary may require paid model calls. The runner includes the narrative (with explicit citation markers) in JSON/text output and returns a failure exit code after saving partial results if synthesis failed.

## Result blocks

Per verified axis: statement 1 is blue at 18px and statement 2 is orange at 14px. These sizes are fixed for every axis. Between them is a fixed-width proportion bar showing people: blue for statement 1, grey for middle, orange for statement 2, and purple for self contradiction. The clickable side counts flank the bar, followed by middle, self contradiction, and unverified counts when present. Each person belongs to exactly one verified class; clicking a class shows that group's verified comment evidence. Unverified counts refer to comments; clicking one opens both scoring-pass outcomes. Clicking the active count again closes it. Each comment includes its author, text, and Hacker News permalink. Consolidated axes for which no comment stance matched between both scoring passes appear separately in a collapsed "Unverified axes" diagnostic section with links to their unverified comments and do not count as result rows. The runner prints the counts in words.

## Configuration

`DEFAULT_CONFIG` in the core block holds the model, sampling (temperature, seed), reasoning, and output ceiling per stage, batch sizes, concurrency, and the budget; the selects, the Max cost box, and the runner's flags override it per run. Sampling and reasoning are per stage because providers accept different parameters; the comment above the model registry in the core block lists them.

## Headless runner

```
node scripts/run_node.js --thread=49525378 [--key=sk-or-...] [--out=result.json] [--concurrency=30] [--cache-dir=path] [--thread-file=path] [--config-file=path] [--extraction=<key>] [--consolidation=<key>] [--scoring=<key>] [--summary=<key>] [--model=id] [--temperature=0] [--seed=12345] [--share=<percent>] [--budget=<usd>]
```

The key comes from `--key` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. `--cache-dir` stores each finished call as a file and reuses it. `--thread-file` reads the thread from that file when it exists, else fetches and saves it, which keeps reruns comparable. `--config-file` is a JSON object of `DEFAULT_CONFIG` overrides; `--extraction`, `--consolidation`, `--scoring`, and `--summary` pick option entries by key, each setting only its own role's stages; `--model`, `--temperature`, and `--seed` apply to every stage; `--share` keeps the top N percent of comments; `--budget` sets the stop.

## Silver reference and benchmark

No person annotates anything in this project. The reference the pickers grade against, called silver, is what two models agree on: GPT-6.1 Sol at xhigh reasoning effort and Claude Opus 5.5 at high reasoning effort, the strongest OpenAI and Anthropic models the project had access to when the reference was built. `node scripts/silver.js --thread=<id>` builds it by running the page's own pipeline with both models, each stage on inputs both models share:

1. Each model extracts candidates. The pool is both models' candidates.
2. Each model consolidates the pool. A silver axis is a pair of axes, one from each model, that are each other's best match by shared candidates and whose shared candidates were held by at least 2 people. The axis keeps the shared candidates, and its wording alternates between the two models. An axis without such a partner is disputed and set aside.
3. Each model scores every comment against the silver axes in the pipeline's two passes. A silver stance is a stance both models gave in both passes. A comment-axis cell in which neither model gave any stance in any pass has no stance. Every other cell is disputed and is not graded.
4. The silver rows are the page's rows for the silver stances. Each model writes a summary of them; an axis both summaries cite is a featured axis.

The reference on thread 22866284 (323 comments, 165k characters): 321 pool candidates, 32 silver axes and 16 disputed axes, 220 silver stances and 149 disputed cells, 4 featured axes. Building it cost $7.58.

`scripts/benchmark.js` grades each picker choice in each of its roles. Only the role under test calls the choice's model; every other stage receives the reference as a fixed response. Adding a model therefore takes one entry in the registry of `hn_polarization.html` and one run, `node scripts/benchmark.js --choice=<key>`, with no combinations to measure. Agreement is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:

| Role | Precision | Recall |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extraction | Of the choice's candidates that both silver models place alike, the share they match to one silver axis | The share of the people on silver axes whose axis received a matched candidate |
| Consolidation | B-cubed precision of the choice's grouping of the pool, over the candidate pairs the silver models group alike | B-cubed recall over the candidate pairs both silver models group together |
| Scoring | Of the stances the choice gives on graded cells, the share equal to the silver stance | The share of the silver stances the choice gives |
| Summary | Of the cited sides both silver models judge alike, the share they judge faithful to the evidence | The share of the featured axes the summary cites |

The run also records what the role's calls cost and how long they took; the forecasts use those figures. `--repeats=<n>` sends a choice's identical request n more times, each answered anew, and the result then holds every run and their means. Results are in `data/silver-benchmark.json` and embedded in the page, so opening a picker makes no API call.

### Choosing the defaults

The contenders for a role's default are the choices whose stage costs at most a quarter of the default Max cost for a thread of 1000 comments. Each contender near the top was run three times, and one whose mean agreement is more than 5 points below the best mean is out; 5 points is the smallest gap three runs can show. That leaves GPT-6 Luna low alone in extraction, where it is both best and cheapest. It leaves several in consolidation and in scoring, and agreement cannot choose among them. The cheapest of them, GPT-6.1 Sol low and GPT-6 Luna low, were therefore run through the whole pipeline against Claude Sonnet 5.5 and GPT-5.6 Luna low, with GPT-6 Luna low extraction and GPT-6 Sol low summary, three runs each (`scripts/pipeline_runs.js`, results in `data/pipeline-benchmark.json`). Each cell is the mean of the three runs, with the lowest and highest run in parentheses. F1 against silver grades a whole run's stances as **Silver reference and benchmark** grades the scoring role, after pairing a run axis with a silver axis when each is the other's most similar axis by the share of comments they have in common.

| Consolidation | Scoring | Thread 22866284: F1 against silver | Thread 22866284: axes, outside "too few" | Thread 44163063: axes, outside "too few" | Thread 44163063: cost, latency |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| GPT-6.1 Sol low | GPT-5.6 Luna low | 44.2% (41.6 to 49.0) | 12.7, 3.7 | 81.3, 34.0 (34 to 34) | $0.87, 238 seconds |
| GPT-6.1 Sol low | GPT-6 Luna low | 38.5% (34.8 to 43.2) | 10.7, 2.0 | 73.7, 28.7 (25 to 31) | $0.47, 190 seconds |
| Claude Sonnet 5.5 | GPT-5.6 Luna low | 37.2% (33.9 to 41.0) | 7.3, 4.3 | 63.7, 35.3 (31 to 41) | $0.96, 261 seconds |
| Claude Sonnet 5.5 | GPT-6 Luna low | 37.7% (33.3 to 42.4) | 8.3, 2.3 | 71.3, 29.0 (29 to 29) | $0.59, 241 seconds |

The default is the pair in the first row. Its lowest run against silver is above the highest run of Claude Sonnet 5.5 with the same scoring, it leaves as many axes outside "too few" on the large thread (34.0 against 35.3, within the runs' spread), and it costs the same. One run of each pair had put Claude Sonnet 5.5 ahead on the large thread, 41 against 34, but 41 was the highest of its three runs. GPT-6 Luna low scores as well as GPT-5.6 Luna low on agreement because its higher precision offsets its lower recall, but it finds about 9 points fewer of the silver stances in every run, and fewer stances leave fewer axes with enough people, in every pair on both threads. Two contenders within the margin were not run through the whole pipeline: GLM 5.3 Flash for scoring, which takes about 11 minutes for 1000 comments, and GPT-6 Astra low for consolidation, which costs about three times as much as Claude Sonnet 5.5. The summary scores do not separate the choices, so its default is the fastest of the choices at 100%.

Limits:

- Silver is model agreement, not truth. Where both models err alike, the reference errs.
- The benchmark thread is small: 4 of its 32 silver axes have enough people for a consensus and none for a split, so every summary choice but one cites the same axes faithfully and reaches 100%. The summary column separates only a weak choice from the rest.
- Consolidation agreement rewards the grain of the silver models, which keep more and narrower axes (32 on thread 22866284) than any whole run of the default contenders (6 to 15). On thread 44163063 (2689 comments) the default models gave 81 axes on average over three runs, 34 of them outside "too few", for $0.87 against a forecast of $0.82.
- The benchmark is one thread. Two runs of one choice differ: across three runs the agreement of one choice ranged over as much as 10 points in consolidation, 7 in extraction, and 4 in scoring, and a fixed seed did not make GPT-6.1 Sol repeat its answer. The contenders for a default have three runs and show the mean; every other choice has one run, so a difference of several points between two of those is not evidence. The summary figures rest on a handful of cited sides per summary and 4 featured axes.
- Claude Opus 5.5 and GPT-6.1 Sol are also picker choices, at other reasoning efforts, graded against a reference their own models helped build. The consolidation default is GPT-6.1 Sol low, so its lead in F1 against silver may be partly that bias; on the large thread, which has no silver, it only ties Claude Sonnet 5.5.
- Extraction and summary are graded with the silver models as judges, which is still model judgment.
